# 1. Introduction
First project of Udacity's React nanodegree, in which a bookshelf app is created that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that users will use to persist information as they interact with the application.
